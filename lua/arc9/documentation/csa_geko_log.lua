Do care did ask
AWP: Done
M4: Done
M9: Done
Garand: Done
Mauser: Done?
AK: Model Done / Scrapped???????
M79: Half
Sten: Model Half?
M30: Scrapped???????
M3: Model Done [SCRAPPED??]
MP5/G3: Model Fifth [SCRAPPED??]
FAL: Model Quarter [SCRAPPED/ Rework?????]
Makarov: Model Half [SCRAPPED]

note myself: 
-use elements instead of attachment check
-you cant use $attachment as a spare point For offhand stuff       use $bonemerge instead
-use a different path for material FUCK YOU CSGO  -- nope doesn't work
-maybe Write the calibre vague to keep the larping hardcore tactile realischism wankers away




EXAMINATION
Modular vs Total Conversion
Pros and Cons

Modular:
100000 bodygroups And potentially conflicting combinations
compiling issues 
Bodgy bodygroup logic
easier to Break (just look at fas2)
extremely tedious to Do
gives the player the feeling of "control" even If most combinations are just window dressings
	ie: If youre using a wooden handguard, youd probably pick a wooden stock and grip as well, might as well make that one option
		If youre using a high calibre mag, youd probably pick a longer handguard/barrel and similar with a low calibre
mixing is always fun (for the players, not me lol its so bloody boring)


Total Conv:
very few bodygroups
fast to prototype And to set up
easier to fix
guarantee to change almost every aspect of the weapons, making every attachment feels sort of different (this is a major strength)
"preset" feeling


the awp was the first gun i made And i opted For a Total Conversion method (barring the stocks), at the Time i thought i had to Do it because
the awp has horrid geometry And separating the grip from the frame is too bloody hard might as well change the entire gun up
as a result the awp was super fun to Do, only took me ~a week to properly set it up

the second gun was the m4 And it took me A WHOLE BLEEDING MONTH, arguably the animating was bloody horrible cuz art block And all but I did NOT Find
ANY JOY when doing the m4

the third gun was the garand (claymore, hammer and sickle dont count) and I opted for a FULL Total Conv method and it was brilliant, never had more fun prototyping
from that moment it was clear, doing modular is the worse way of handling this

the fourth gun was the m9 and I tried a hybird system but not like how I handle the awp, particularly with the auto and burst frame
ehhh not worth it, just window dressings but it feels necessary

the fifth was the mauser and of course it was quick, dirty and fun, but this is the only gun that i feel like i shouldve done a Modular on

the sixth will be a sten or m79, both will be made using a total conv method, though probably a hybrid for the m79 cuz funi 12g shotgun momento

the main reason the ak fell off so hard was because		ehhh lazy	but again like the m4 its too modular
the m4 itself has some total conversion like the cs5, mass26 and so on but that was mostly because of bodygroup issue
it was clear that my lazy arse no matter how much Time you grant me will refuse to finish the ak, too bloody much for an arse like mine to handle (dont take this out of context)

from here Then on only the optics, foregrips and muzzles will be Modular
