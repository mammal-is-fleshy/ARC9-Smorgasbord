note myself: 
-use elements instead of attachment check
-you cant use $attachment as a spare point For offhand stuff       use $bonemerge instead
-use a different path for material FUCK YOU CSGO





The receiver is the meat of this mod
Ideally each modification should change the animations And how the weapons handle (stats and all)
All the stuff like handguard And stock And what have you are just window dressing And should Not be the focus (how the fuck Do i handle pistols????)
